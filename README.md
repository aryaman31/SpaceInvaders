# SpaceInvaders
This is a simple clone of the space invaders game created using pygame. 

I created this as a means to learn how Pygame works and just get the hang of the system. 

Once the game begins, you have to press the space button to begin. The controlls for the game are very simple. Left 
and right arrow keys for movement with space button to shoot. 

Be Aware!! the bad guys (red boxes) shoot back and get closer slowly.
